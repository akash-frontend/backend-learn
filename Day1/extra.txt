Servers and Databases

In browser like we request google.com index.html file now request goes to server and server request data from database 
and then data goes to server and server sent it to browser

We do API call to get data from server to browser as browser understand html files
server understand nodejs

API 
Application Programming Interface

Jargons of backend
Servers 
database 
api

Servers are intermediatary between frontend and database
If fetches data from database
If there is some computation on it
It does computation and cleans the data and send it to frontend

Api is interface which helps in communicating between browsers, server's and database

Programming are just set of rules that you create
to tell your computer to do something

Nodes js handle high traffic


Install nodejs from nvm
nvm install latest
nvm install v16
